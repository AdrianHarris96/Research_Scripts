Descriptions 
- `generate_slopes.R`: Calculate partial correlations for each ancestry (in relation to UK pcor) and plot against PC distance from the UK ancestry. Apply a linear model and extract coefficients to generate plots illustrating the "portability" of traits via the shallowness of the slopes.
